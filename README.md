Repositiory Description
====================================

This repository contains my vimrc file. I've uploaded it to github for the purpose of sharing with any interested people.
Additionally, to keep record of how the file changes as I learn the vim text editor, and eventually some vimscript.

The initial .vimrc file is filled with mappings and minor customizations that I have already picked up.
